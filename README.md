# isomount
Easily mount and unmount iso files and squashfs files.

There is a lot of commonality in the scripts so there is
only one real script and the others are symlinks to it.

What's new?
-----------
isomount version 00.04.02 (Thu Mar 29 21:39:34 MDT 2018)
     dfh version 00.04.02 (Thu Mar 29 21:38:39 MDT 2018

* Add a --gui option to display results in yad

* Add 4 desktop files that use gui mode. The ones for
isomount and isoumount allow for drag-and-drop if they
are displayed in rox-filer.  The spacefm desktop/pinboard
doesn't work and the spacefm filar doesn't work but, like
rox-filer, you can drag from it.

* Note: if "stty size" doesn't give us a non-zero width
then we automatically use gui mode.  This was one of
the tricks needed to work with gksu.  (((((sigh)))))


TLDR:
-----

**Mount an iso file (and its linuxfs file if it is antiX/MX):**

    isomount /path/to/iso-file.iso

**Unmount the most recently mounted iso file (and its linuxfs file if needed):**

    isoumount

**Unmount all the files we have mounted:**

    isoumount all

**Show what files are mounted:**

    show-isoumount

**Show all mounted file systems in a very human friendly format:**

    dfh

Quick Start
-----------
If you clone or copy this repo then you can use the utilities
directly from the repo.  Example:

    ./isomount /some/iso-file.iso

Use the following command to install the utilities to /usr/local/bin

    sudo make install ROOT=

Here are the other Makefile commands:

    make help                 show this help
    make install              install to current directory

The utilities are still rough around the edges but they are a big
improvement over the scripts I've been using for many years.

Usage
-----
**isomount [options] /path/to/file.iso**

Mount the iso file specified at a directory like /mnt/iso1/.  If
it is an MX or antiX iso then also mount the /antiX/linuxfs file
as a squashfs file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**sqmount [options] /path/to/squashfs-file**

Mount the squashfs file specified at a directory like /mnt/sq1/

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**isoumount [options] [/mnt/iso2|'all']**

Umount the most recently mounted iso file.  If a mountpoint is
given then unmount that mountpoint instead.

If 'all' is given then we umount all of our mounts

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**squmount [options] [/mnt/sq2|'all']**

Umount the most recently mounted squashfs file.  If a mountpoint is
given then unmount that mountpoint instead.

If 'all' is given then we umount all of our mounts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**clean-isomount [options]**

Clean up leftover mountpoint directories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**show-isomount [options]**

Show the currently mounted iso and squashfs files

Options
-------

The following options are available for all six commands.

    -c --color=<xxx>   set color scheme to off|low|low2|bw|dark|high
    -g --gui           show output in a yad window
    -h --help          show this usage
    -H --header=<type>   change header color: norm, rev1, rev2, rev3
                                             (n,      r1,   r2,   r3)
    -q --quiet         only show mountpoints
    -Q --Quiet         don't show mountpoint(s)
    -s --silent        don't print error message
    -v --version       show version number and exit
    -V --verbose       be more verbose

Some options may not pertain to all commands.

Notes
-----
Normally I add use a hyphen in the filenames like "iso-mount" to
make them more clear but I got rid of them in order to make
tab completion a little easier.  The four standard commands only
require 4 or 3 letters to be typed before you press <Tab>.

If there is a problem with the symlinks you can get all of the
functionality by using the ACTION environment variable.  For
example:

    ACTION=isoumount ./isomount

If you want to unmount something that is not or may not be
the last one created then just use the normal umount command.
Example:

   umount /mnt/iso3

The directory will still remain but it will be removed the next time
one of the scripts is called is called that needs root.

If you do not have root privileges and if you call a script that
needs needs them then the script uses "sudo" as needed.  If you
don't have sudo on you system then just make sure you always call
them as root.

This started as 36 lines of code that has worked well for me for
many years. It has now blossomed to over 400 lines of code.  A
number of my programs are like that.  The start with a core of under
50 lines (often much less) and then grow by a factor of 10 or more.
That's user friendliness for you.
